### What is a web server?

A web server is both **hardware** and **software** that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.  
- On the **hardware** side, it is a computer that stores web server software and a websiteâ€™s component files.
- On the **software** side, it includes the server operating system and web server software such as Apache, Nginx, or IIS, which handles requests and delivers web content.

### What is virtualization?

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single physical hardware system. This allows for more efficient use of physical hardware and isolation between different operating systems.

### What is VirtualBox?

VirtualBox is a free and open-source hosted hypervisor developed by Oracle. It enables users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine using virtual machines.

### What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine, but it is managed by a hypervisor on the host machine.
